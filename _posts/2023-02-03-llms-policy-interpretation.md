Deep reinforcement learning has proven to be a highly successful method for creating intelligent systems in recent times. the noteworthy results that have been accomplished by reinforcement learning techniques, the policies - which determine the actions of an agent based on its environment – are often complex, opaque, and difficult to understand. This barrier prevents deep interrogation and understanding of the decision-making process utilised by the RL model.

On the other hand, natural language models have made [significant progress](https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/gpt-3/) in the past few years, providing a natural basis for human-AI interaction. Language models have the potential to bridge the gap between reinforcement learning policies and human understanding. By providing natural language explanations for reinforcement learning policies, it becomes easier to understand and interpret them, leading to more effective AI systems that are better [aligned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) with human objectives and preferences.

The main challenge of interpreting deep reinforcement learning policies is their complexity. Deep neural networks are inherently difficult to reason about, and as learned policies take into account numerous factors, such as the current state of the environment, the reward signal, and the agent's past experiences, the resultant decision-making process is also inherently abstract.
Some methods to explain reinforcement learning policies are to visualise the learned policies as graphs or heat maps, or building saliency maps to highlight the important factors in the decision-making process. While these methods are indeed useful, they are limited in their ability to provide a natural and intuitive explanation of the learned policies.

This is where language models could in the future play a crucial role. Consider an AI system that uses reinforcement learning to control a robot in a warehouse. The learned policy determines the actions the robot should take based on its environment and past experiences, optimising for efficiency and safety. A language model could provide a natural language explanation for this policy, making it easier to understand and interpret. For instance, the language model could explain that "the robot chose to pick up a larger package out of order because it has learned that this action will clear space and allow it to progress through the remaining packages faster." This type of explanation increases the transparency and accountability of the AI system, helping to ensure that it is aligned with human objectives and preferences.

While there has been some [successful work](https://innermonologue.github.io/) in this realm , there is currently a disconnect and lack of interface between these two fields. Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed to optimize reward signals and do not have built-in mechanisms for generating human-readable explanations, while language models don’t have the ability to generate novel strategies or make decisions based on an explicit environment and reward signal.

The integration of reinforcement learning and language models has the potential to lead to more effective and understandable AI systems, which are better aligned with human objectives and preferences. However, until there is a generalised unification of reinforcement learning and large language models, the current approaches for policy interpretation will have to do.
