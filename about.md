I'm a software engineer / machine learning engineer experienced in full-stack web development and deep learning, with just enough iOS experience to be dangerous.

### Experience

My professional roles have required me to be a jack of most trades. This has resulted in me:

- Performing machine learning research and model development.
- Visualising and communicating technical projects to non-technical stakeholders.
- Designing (and co-designing) applications for web, desktop, and mobile.
- Engineering and deploying full-stack applications to those environments.
- Building out CICD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- Managing cloud infrastructure.
