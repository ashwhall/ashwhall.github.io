Hi, I'm Ash Hall. I'm currently doing an Honours Degree in Computer Science, studying meta-learning with convolutional neural networks for computer vision.
I work as a deep-learning research assistant with [La Trobe University](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/), [The Australian Institute of Sport](https://www.ausport.gov.au/ais), and [Swimming Australia](https://www.swimming.org.au/home.aspx). I also occasionally demonstrate labs/tutorials within the university.

### My History
