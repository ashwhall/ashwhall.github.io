Hi, I'm Ash Hall. I completed a double-degree in Computer Science and Science (Mathematics) at La Trobe University in 2017.
I'm currently doing an Honours in Computer Science, studying meta-learning with convolutional neural networks for computer vision.
I work as a deep-learning research assistant with [La Trobe University](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/), [The Australian Institute of Sport](https://www.ausport.gov.au/ais), and [Swimming Australia](https://www.swimming.org.au/home.aspx). I also occasionally demonstrate labs/tutorials within the university.

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
